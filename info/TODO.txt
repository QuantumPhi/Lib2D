Key:
  [x] -> Complete
  [/] -> Partial
  [ ] -> Incomplete

  Code:
    [x] Create repository
    [x] Create README.md
    [x] Create LICENSE.md
    [x] Create TODO.md
    [x] Create rudimentary game framework
    [x] Create rudimentary physics engine
    [ ] Expand functionality of framework
    [ ] Create more advanced physics engine
    [ ] Release test builds
  
  Objectives:
    - Make the code modular: This library
        should be able to work with other
        game engines.
    - Make the code independent: This library
        is geared towards overall game framework
        and physics, not rendering. Thus, it
        should not rely on other libraries like
        LWJGL, Slick2D, or LibGDX
    - Make the code lightweight: This library
        should not be bloated. All code should
        be as lightweight as possible.
